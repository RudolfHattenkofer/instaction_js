= instaction.js

Lets you register selectors for elements with a callback that is run every time a matching DOM element is added to the page. This can be useful if you have a lot of elements that are loaded via AJAX or otherwise added later on.

The most obvious use-case is replacing select tags on dynamically loaded forms with something more fancy, e.g. {Chosen}[http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/]

== Installation
=== Rails
Install the gem:

    gem 'instaction_js', git: 'git://github.com/RudolfHattenkofer/instaction_js'

Require in your Javascript source file:

    //= require instaction

Define actions!

    Instaction.register('.some-klass', function( $node ) {
        // Do stuff
    });


=== Other
This is packed as a Rails gem for ease of use, but for non-Rails projects you can just grab this file: link:app/assets/javascripts/instaction.js

    <script src="instaction.js"></script>

== Usage
There is currently only one option this library has: How to process a selector. Either you pass a class name, the default:

    Instaction.register('.some-klass', function( $node ) {
        // Do stuff
    });

or a jQuery selector:

    Instaction.register('[data-tooltip]', 'jquery', function( $node ) {
        // Do stuff
    });

That's it!

== Important notes
Make to sure to require this script in the header, since only elements *added* to the DOM are processed. If it is loaded at the bottom of the page, all the elements will already be existing and the callback fires only for future insertions!
